# Missingness

## Introduction

When fitting models to a particular dataset, missingness is of particular 
concern. Missing data can lead to biased coefficient estimates. Therefore, a 
good understanding of the different missingness patterns, their implications on
model fitting, and how to deal with them is essential. There are three 
missingness patterns (missingness mechanisms):

* missingness completely at random (MCAR)
* missingness at random (MAR)
* missingness not at random (MNAR).

In the following sections, we will use a simulated dataset containing data on 
patients and their weight and BMI to illustrate these different mechanisms.

## Missingess Patterns

### Simulation Setup

Our simulation setup involves simulating the weight of patients visiting their
general physician (GP) for a checkup. For each patient, the sex (male, female)
is always recorded. The dataset is balanced in terms of sex, and we assume a
normally distributed weight (kg) with a mean weight $\mu_{f} = 65$ for women and
$\mu_{m} = 78$ for men. The standard deviation $\sigma = 10$ is the same for
both sexes:

$$
W_{f} \sim \mathcal{N}(65, 100)
$$

and

$$
W_{m} \sim \mathcal{N}(78, 100).
$$

We also simulate the BMI for these patients. We assume the BMI is normally
distributed as follows:

$$
BMI \sim \mathcal{N}(25, 9).
$$

```{r}
# Simulate patient data. The dataset contains 10000 observations, and is 
# balanced in terms of sex.
set.seed(123)
n <- 10000

# Define the parameters that define the distribution of weight and BMI
sd_bmi <- 3
mu_bmi <- 25

sd_weight <- 10
mu_weight_f <- 65
mu_weight_m <- 78

weights <- tibble::tibble(
  idx = 1:n,
  sex = rep(x = c("F", "M"), each = n / 2),
  weight = c(
    rnorm(n / 2, mu_weight_f, sd_weight),
    rnorm(n / 2, mu_weight_m, sd_weight)
  ),
  bmi = round(rnorm(n, mu_bmi, sd_bmi), 1)
)
```

We can see that the conditional distributions of weight given sex have different 
means. Female patients show a mean weight of 
`r round(mean(weights[weights$sex == "F",, drop = F]$weight), 2)` kg (standard
deviation (SD): `r round(sd(weights[weights$sex == "F",, drop = F]$weight), 2)`)
(male patients: `r round(mean(weights[weights$sex == "M",, drop = F]$weight), 2)`
(SD: `r round(sd(weights[weights$sex == "M",, drop = F]$weight), 2)`))

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Weight Conditional on Sex",
    x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

But the conditional distributions of BMI are the same.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of BMI Conditional on Sex",
    x = "BMI ", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Missingness Completely at Random

Missingness completely at random indicates that the observations with missing
values are a random subset of all observations. There are no factors that affect
the probability of missingness, nor is the probability of missingess affected by
the outcome itself (weight or BMI). The distribution of observed and missing
values is the same.

```{r}
# Simulate MCAR: assume that 30% of observations have a missing outcome
set.seed(123)
idxs <- sample(x = n, size = n * 0.3)
weights["mcar"] <- weights$idx %in% idxs
```

Because the observations with missing values are a random subset of all
observations, we should see no difference between the distributions of missing
and observed values.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ mcar, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Weight Conditional on Missingness (MCAR)",
    x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Missingness at Random

With missingness at random, we believe there are certain factors that affect the
probability of missingness, and that these same factors also have an effect on
the outcome. In our example, we see that sex affects the weight. We now assume
that sex also affects the probability of missingness.

```{r}
# Determine the conditional probabilities of missingness
p_missing_f <- 0.45
p_missing_m <- 0.25

idxs <- c(
  sample(
    x = weights[weights$sex == "F", "idx", drop = T],
    size = (n / 2) * p_missing_f
  ),
  sample(
    x = weights[weights$sex == "M", "idx", drop = T],
    size = (n / 2) * p_missing_m
  )
)
weights["mar"] <- weights$idx %in% idxs
```

Inspection of the distributions of observed and missing values shows us that the
distribution of missing values is shifted to the left compared to the
distribution of observed values.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ mar, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Weight Conditional on Missingness (MAR)",
    x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Because the probability of missingness is higher for women then for men, the
fraction of patients with a missing weight that are female is higher than the
fraction of patients with a missing weight that are men. This affects the
distribution of the missing weights, i.e., shifting the distribution to the
left. Assume that sex is the only factor that affects the probability of
missingness, then, conditional on sex, the distribution of observed values and
missing values is the same.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(mar), cols = vars(sex)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Weight Conditional on Sex and Missingness (MAR)",
    x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

We can see that, conditional on sex, the distribution of observed and missing
weights is the same. This illustrates the concept of missingness at random. Sex
is the factor that influences both the probability of missingness and the
outcome itself. Conditioning on this factors removes the difference in
distributions of observed and missing weights.

In practice, it is impossible to conclude missingness at random by comparing the
distribution of observed and missing values as the missing values are, of
course, missing. This example just demonstrates the concept of missingness at
random.

### Missingness Not at Random

With missingness not at random, the probability of missingness is not affected 
by a factor that is recorded, but is affected by factors that are not recorded 
or even by the outcome itself. For this missingness pattern, we will not focus
on the weight of the patient but on the patient's BMI. The distribution of BMI 
is the same for women and for men:

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ sex, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of BMI Conditional on Sex",
    x = "BMI", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

However, we could argue the following: if a patient visits the GP, then the GP
will more likely weigh the patient if he/she seems overweight or obese. We could
make the same argument for underweight patients, but for the sake of
illustration, we will assume the likelihood of being weighted is higher for
overweight and obese patients. Based on BMI, we can classify patients as:

* underweight: $BMI < 18.5$
* normal: $18.5 \leq BMI \leq 24.9$
* overweight: $25 \leq BMI \leq 29.9$
* obese: $30 \leq BMI$.

We assume the following conditional probabilities of missingness:

```{r}
# Define conditional probabilities of missingness
p_missing_uw_nw <- 0.75 # underweight and normal weight
p_missing_ow_ob <- 0.55 # overweight and obese
```

```{r}
# Classify patients based on their BMI
weights <- weights %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    bmi_class = dplyr::case_when(
      bmi < 18.5 ~ "uw",
      dplyr::between(bmi, 18.5, 24.9) ~ "nw",
      dplyr::between(bmi, 25.0, 29.9) ~ "ow",
      bmi >= 30.0 ~ "ob"
    )
  )
```

```{r}
fd_bmi_classes_df <- weights %>%
  dplyr::group_by(bmi_class) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n = n())

fd_bmi_classes <- fd_bmi_classes_df$n
names(fd_bmi_classes) <- fd_bmi_classes_df$bmi_class
```

```{r}
set.seed(456)

idxs <- c(
  sample(
    x = weights[weights$bmi_class %in% c("uw", "nw"), "idx", drop = T],
    size = round((fd_bmi_classes["uw"] + fd_bmi_classes["nw"]) * p_missing_uw_nw)
  ),
  sample(
    x = weights[weights$bmi_class %in% c("ow", "ob"), "idx", drop = T],
    size = round((fd_bmi_classes["ow"] + fd_bmi_classes["ob"]) * p_missing_ow_ob)
  )
)
weights["mnar"] <- weights$idx %in% idxs
```

First, let's have a look at the distribution of BMI conditional on missingness.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~ mnar, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of BMI Conditional on Missingness (MNAR)",
    x = "BMI", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The distribution of the missing BMI values is shifted to the left compared to 
the distribution of the observed BMI values. This makes sense as the probability
of the weight being recorded, and thus the BMI being calculated, is bigger as 
a patient tends to be overweight or obese.

We know from our simulation that sex does not influence the probability of 
missigness, nor is there any other factor that influences the probability of 
missingness, only the outcome itself. Therefore, conditioning on sex, will not 
eliminate the difference in distribution between observed and missing values.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(weights, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(mnar), cols = vars(sex)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of BMI Conditional on Sex and Missingness (MNAR)",
    x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Handling Missingness

In the following sections, we will look at different methods to handle
missingness. First, we specify what it is that we are trying to estimate.
Second, we determine the estimator that is used to estimate our estimand. Then,
we will use simulation to demonstrate the properties of this estimator and how
different techniques to handle missing data have an impact on the properties
of this estimator.

Our estimand is the population mean weight. We know what the distribution of the
weight is in male and female patients. We also know that the patient population
is balanced (50% male patients, 50% female patients). Given the distributions,
we can calculate the population mean weight using the law of iterated
expectations:

$$
\mathbb{E}(Y) = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(Y | X)]
$$

with $Y$ the weight in kg and $X$ the sex (male, female). This gives:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}(Y) 
  &= \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}(Y | X)] \\
  &= \sum_{x \in X} \mathbb{E}(Y | X) \cdot \mathbb{P}(X = x) \\
  &= 65 \cdot 0.50 + 78 \cdot 0.50 \\
  &= 71.5
\end{align}
$$

We can also calculate the variance of the weight in the patient population. We
know that the variance of the weight in the male and female patient population
is the same, i.e., $\sigma^2 = 100$. The weight between male and female patients
is independent. So, the variance of $Y$ can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{align}
Var(Y) 
  &= \mathbb{P}(X = female) \cdot Var(Y_f)
    + \mathbb{P}(X = male) 
    + \mathbb{P}(X = female) (1 - \mathbb{P}(X = male)) + (\mu_f - \mu_m)^2 \\
  &= 100 + 0.25 \cdot (65 - 78)^2 \\
  &= 142.25
\end{align}
$$

So, we have $Var(Y) = \sigma^2 = 142.25$ and $\sigma = 11.93$ kg.

## No Missing Data

We are trying to estimate the population mean weight $\mu = 71.5$ kg.
To do this, we use the following estimator:

$$
\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{i = 1}^{n} Y_i
$$

The properties we will focus on are bias and precision. An estimator is unbiased
if its expectation equals the true value of the population parameter it is trying
to estimate (the estimand):

$$
bias(\hat{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}(\hat{\theta}) - \theta
$$

The precision of an estimator $\hat{\theta}$ can be quantified by the variance
or standard error of the estimator. For our estimator $\overline{X}$, the
standard error can be calculated as follows:

$$
SE(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

We can use simulations to check whether our estimator is unbiased and to assess
its variability. We draw a random sample with $n = 1000$ patients. There is
stratified sampling, so the sample always contains 500 female and 500 male
patients. The estimator is used to produce an estimate of the population mean.

```{r}
# Simulate patient data. The dataset contains 10000 observations, and is 
# balanced in terms of sex.
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
N <- 10000

# Define the parameters that define the distribution of weight and BMI
sd_bmi <- 3
mu_bmi <- 25

sd_weight <- 10
mu_weight_f <- 65
mu_weight_m <- 78

estimated_means <- rep(NA, N)

for (i in 1L:N) {
  
  weights <- tibble::tibble(
    idx = 1:n,
    sex = rep(x = c("F", "M"), each = n / 2),
    weight = c(
      rnorm(n / 2, mu_weight_f, sd_weight),
      rnorm(n / 2, mu_weight_m, sd_weight)
    ),
    bmi = round(rnorm(n, mu_bmi, sd_bmi), 1)
  )
  
  estimated_means[i] <- mean(weights$weight)
  
}
```

The mean of the estimated means equals `r round(mean(estimated_means), 2)`,
which equals the actual population mean weight of $\mu = 71.5$. Furthermore,
we see that the standard error of $\overline{X}$ is $SE(\overline{X}) = 
`r round(sd(estimated_means), 4)`$.

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(tibble::tibble(weight = estimated_means), aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, alpha = 0.1, color = "gray") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Weight Conditional on Missingness (MCAR)",
    x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 71.5, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(estimated_means), color = "darkred", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Complete Case Analysis

Complete case analysis is a technique where only those observations without
missing data are used to produce estimates of the estimand. We define a binary
variable $O_i$, with $O_i = 1$ if the outcome is observed for patient $i$ and
$O_i = 0$ otherwise. Our estimator is now:

$$
\overline{Y} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} O_i} \cdot \sum_{i = 1}^{n} O_i \cdot Y_i
$$

### MCAR

Under MCAR, the observations with missing values are a random subset of the
sample, and therefore the sample is still representative of the population. This
implies that the estimator is unbiased. However, due to dropping incomplete
observations from the sample, the sample will be less efficient (more imprecise).

```{r}
# Simulate patient data. The dataset contains 10000 observations, and is 
# balanced in terms of sex.
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
N <- 10000

# Define the parameters that define the distribution of weight and BMI
sd_bmi <- 3
mu_bmi <- 25

sd_weight <- 10
mu_weight_f <- 65
mu_weight_m <- 78

estimated_means <- rep(NA, N)

for (i in 1L:N) {
  
  weights <- tibble::tibble(
    idx = 1:n,
    sex = rep(x = c("F", "M"), each = n / 2),
    weight = c(
      rnorm(n / 2, mu_weight_f, sd_weight),
      rnorm(n / 2, mu_weight_m, sd_weight)
    ),
    bmi = round(rnorm(n, mu_bmi, sd_bmi), 1)
  )
  
  idxs <- sample(x = n, size = n * 0.3)
  weights["mcar"] <- weights$idx %in% idxs
  estimated_means[i] <- (1 / sum(!weights$mcar)) * sum(weights[!weights$mcar,, drop = F]$weight)
  
}
```

We see that the mean of the estimates `r round(mean(estimated_means), 2)`
equals the population mean $\mu = 71.5$. The standard error of the estimator
is quite larger than the one under the previous section:
`r round(sd(estimated_means), 4)`.
